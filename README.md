# `RayTerm`

A Ray-Tracing Graphics Engine for XTerm-like Terminals


This repository is the GPU implementation of `RayTerm`. There is also an
incomplete CPU implementation, available [here](https://github.com/Michionlion/rayterm-cpu).

## Development

### Dependencies

`RayTerm` requires the [OptiX 6.0.0 SDK](http://raytracing-docs.nvidia.com/optix_6_0/index.html)
to compile. It assumes the SDK is installed to `/opt/optix`.
